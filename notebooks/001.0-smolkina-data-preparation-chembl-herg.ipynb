The most common mechanism for these adverse events is the inhibition of one or more cardiac potassium channels, in particular hERG. This current is important for cardiac myocyte repolarization and is a common target for drugs that prolong the QT interval. Test articles in this study were therefore characterized to determine their ability to inhibit the hERG channel. Ion channel activity was measured using a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line expressing the hERG mRNA. The pharmacology of this cloned channel expressed in the CHO cell line is very similar to that observed in native tissue.'\n",

The cells used were Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with hERG. A single-cell suspension is prepared in extracellular solution (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium pH 7-7.2) and aliquots added automatically to each well of a PatchPlate™. The cells were then positioned over a small hole at the bottom of each well by applying a vacuum beneath the plate to form an electrical seal. The vacuum was applied through a single compartment common to all wells which is filled with intracellular solution (buffered to pH 7.2 with HEPES). The resistance of each seal was measured via a common ground-electrode in the intracellular compartment and individual electrodes placed into each of the upper wells. Electrical access to the cell was achieved by circulating a perforating agent, amphotericin, underneath the PatchPlate™ and then measuring the pre-compound hERG current. An electrode was positioned in the extracellular compartment and a holding potential of −80 mV applied for 15 sec. The hERG channels were then activated by applying a depolarising step to +40 mV for 5 sec and then clamped at −50 mV for 4 sec to elicit the hERG tail current, before returning to −80 mV for 0.3 s. The test compound was then added at various concentrations (0.008, 0.04, 0.2, 1, 5 and 25 μM) to the upper wells of the PatchPlate™.

Cultured CHO cells stably expressing hERG channels (provided by Sophion Biosciences, Denmark) were harvested from culture flasks of 70-90% cell confluence rate and prepared as cell suspension with a cell density of 3-8&timse;10^6 cells/mL in serum-free media (CHO-S-SFM II, cat#12052 Invitrogen; 25 mM HEPES). Cells in such condition were placed into a Qpatch cell stir chamber and used within 4 hours. For each run, cells were first spun down by the built-in Qpatch centrifuge and re-suspended in an extracellular solution (in mM, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 4 KCl, 145 NaCl, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, osmolarity ~305 mOsm). Qplate-48 that holds one cell in each of its 48 channels for the later voltage-clamped assay were primed with the extracellular solution and intracellular solution (in mM, 5.4 CaCl2, 1.75 MgCl2, 120 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 4 NaATP, pH 7.25, Osmolarity ~280-295 mOsm). Cells were dispatched by Qpatch robotic dispensing guns into each Qplate channel and went through the process of giga-ohm sealing and whole cell configuration. Whole-cell recordings were performed in voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential of −80 mV. The hERG current was activated by depolarizing at +20 mV for 5 sec, after which the current was taken back to −50 mV for 5 sec to remove the inactivation and observe the deactivating tail current. The maximum amount of tail current size was used to determine the hERG current amplitude. The above voltage protocol was applied to the cells every 15 sec throughout the whole procedure. External solution containing 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) was applied to the cells to establish the baseline. Compound solution was added, and the cells were kept in the test solution until the compound's effect reached a steady state or for a maximum of 4 min. For dose response assays (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 μM), the compound was applied to the cells accumulatively from low to high concentrations. Washout with extracellular solution was performed after compound testing. Positive control cisapride 0.1 μM was used on each cell after compound testing to ensure the normal response and the good quality of the cell.\"\n",

      " 'Inhibition Assay: The inhibition of the hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channel can be determined as described in Rast, G., & Guth, B. D., Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/i.vascn.2014.08.001.'\n",
      " 'Inhibition Assay: The hERG inhibition study aims at quantifying the in vitro effects of compounds of the invention on the potassium-selective IKf current generated in normoxic conditions in stably transfected HEK 293 cells with the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG).Whole-cell currents (acquisition by manual patch-clamp) elicited during a voltage pulse were recorded in baseline conditions and following application of tested compounds (5 minutes of exposure). The concentrations of tested compounds (0.3 uM; 3 uM; 10 uM; 30 uM) reflect a range believed to exceed the concentrations at expected efficacy doses in preclinical models.The pulses protocol applied is described as follow: the holding potential (every 3 seconds) was stepped from -80 mV to a maximum value of +40 mV, starting with -40 mV, in eight increments of +10 mV, for a period of 1 second. The membrane potential was then returned to -55 mV, after each of these incremented steps, for 1 second and finally repolarized to -80 mV for 1 second.Â\\xa0 The current density recorded were normalized against the baseline conditions and corrected for solvent effect and time-dependent current run-down using experimental design in test compound free conditions.Â\\xa0 Inhibition curves were obtained for compounds and the concentrations which decreased 50% of the current density determined in the baseline conditions (IC50) were determined. All compounds for which the IC50 value is above 10 uM are not considered to be potent inhibitors of the hERG channel whereas compounds with IC50 values below 1 uM are considered potent hERG channel inhibitors.'\n",
