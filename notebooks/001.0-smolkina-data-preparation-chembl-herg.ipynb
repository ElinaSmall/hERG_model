      " 'Potassium Channel Assay: Drugs belonging to different classes have been shown to be associated with QT prolongation and in some cases serious ventricular arrhythmias. The most common mechanism for these adverse events is the inhibition of one or more cardiac potassium channels, in particular hERG. This current is important for cardiac myocyte repolarization and is a common target for drugs that prolong the QT interval. Test articles in this study were therefore characterized to determine their ability to inhibit the hERG channel. Ion channel activity was measured using a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line expressing the hERG mRNA. The pharmacology of this cloned channel expressed in the CHO cell line is very similar to that observed in native tissue.'\n",

A single-cell suspension is prepared in extracellular solution (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium pH 7-7.2) and aliquots added automatically to each well of a PatchPlate™. The cells were then positioned over a small hole at the bottom of each well by applying a vacuum beneath the plate to form an electrical seal. The vacuum was applied through a single compartment common to all wells which is filled with intracellular solution (buffered to pH 7.2 with HEPES). The resistance of each seal was measured via a common ground-electrode in the intracellular compartment and individual electrodes placed into each of the upper wells. Electrical access to the cell was achieved by circulating a perforating agent, amphotericin, underneath the PatchPlate™ and then measuring the pre-compound hERG current. An electrode was positioned in the extracellular compartment and a holding potential of −80 mV applied for 15 sec. The hERG channels were then activated by applying a depolarising step to +40 mV for 5 sec and then clamped at −50 mV for 4 sec to elicit the hERG tail current, before returning to −80 mV for 0.3 s.
